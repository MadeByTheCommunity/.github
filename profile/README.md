# Better Together

This project is based on the belief that what we make is made better when we share and work together. Creating a community where Community Developers[^devs] collaborate, establish standards, and share ideas enhances the unique value of each project and the benefit these projects provide to the Citizens[^citizens] in the community.

# Open Principles

Thriving communities are dedicated to open principles. Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] agreed to uphold these principles in their projects.

- Open Development

- Open Contribution

- Open Standards

- Open API

This organization represents a personal passion to enable this vision.

## What this does and does not mean
> “free” as in “free speech” not as in “free beer” -- GNU / Free Software Foundation
### Open Development
Agreeing to these principles does *not* mean that Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] lose creative control over their projects. This does *not* mean that Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] must choose an open-source license [^open-source] It also does *not* mean that Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] cannot solicit and accept financial support (quite the opposite in fact!) because the goal is healthy and sustainable development.

What this means is that Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] agree to be open with their project development, such as using a public repository on GitHub. Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] agree to make the tool freely accessible to Citizens[^citizens] without a paywall or ORG[^ORG] membership requirement[^no-paywall].  Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] are encouraged to provide a means of quick access to elective donations, RSI[^RSI] referral code signups and invitations to their dedicated community sites such as Discord and RSI ORG[^ORG].

### Open Contribution
This does *not* mean that Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] must allow everyone to be a contributor in their project.
What this means is that Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] agree to participate in dialog with other Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] to share experiences and best practices. Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] also agree to consider the input and collaboration opportunities that the broader community of Citizens[^citizens] can offer them.

### Open Standards
Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] agree to collaborate on, establish and leverage existing draft specification standards for game data. This ensures that best practices for handling game data can be implemented and benefit all projects. This also reduces redundant work trying to solve when breaking changes occur on the RSI[^RSI] website or Star Citizen[^star-citizen] game side and member projects can regain functionality more quickly. Open standards provide a consisten means of exporting, importing and updating game data and hangar data between projects. The ultimate goal is maximizing the value that Citizens[^citizens] derive from using projects from Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs].

### Open API
This does not mean that every project must have an API. However, whenever it makes sense, Citizen Developers[^citizen-devs] agree to make their project accessible from and interoperable through the use of an API that leverages the Open Standards above. Tools such as an app that collects hangar information or provides fleet viewing.
