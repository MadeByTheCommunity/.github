# Better Together

This project is based on the belief that what we make is made better when we share and work together. Creating a community where "made by the community" developers collaborate, establish standards, and share ideas enhances the unique value of each project and the benefit they provide to the Star Citizen community.

# Open Principles

Thriving communities are dedicated to open principles. Member community developer projects have agreed to uphold certain these principles.

- Open Development

- Open Contribution

- Open Standards

- Open API

This organization is a personal passion to enable this vision.
